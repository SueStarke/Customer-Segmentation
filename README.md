# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project focuses on **Customer Segmentation** using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, a powerful tool to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior. By segmenting customers into different groups, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies more effectively, leading to higher customer satisfaction, increased retention rates, and optimized marketing efforts.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the raw and processed data files used in the analysis.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks used to clean data, perform the RFM analysis, and visualize the results.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts that can be run to automate parts of the process.
- **reports/**: Generated reports and visualizations from the analysis.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and how to use it.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
- To analyze customer data and segment them based on their purchasing behavior.
- To develop targeted marketing strategies for different customer segments.
- To provide actionable insights that can help improve customer engagement and retention.

## RFM Analysis

The **RFM analysis** segments customers based on three dimensions:
- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency**: How often a customer makes a purchase.
- **Monetary**: How much money a customer spends on purchases.

Customers are assigned a score (usually from 1 to 5) in each of these three dimensions, and these scores are combined to form the RFM segments. 

### Example Segments:
- **Champions**: High value customers who buy often and have purchased recently.
- **Loyal Customers**: Regular buyers who contribute consistently.
- **Potential Loyalists**: Recent buyers with the potential to become loyal.
- **At Risk**: Customers who used to buy often but haven’t purchased in a while.
- **Sleepyheads**: Customers who haven’t purchased in a long time and may be inactive.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project includes customer transaction data such as:
- **Customer ID**
- **Transaction Date**
- **Number of Orders**
- **Product ID**

The data is cleaned and processed to ensure accuracy and consistency before applying the RFM analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicate records, and incorrect data types.
2. **RFM Calculation**: The Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values are calculated for each customer.
3. **Segmentation**: Customers are segmented based on their RFM scores.
4. **Visualization**: The customer segments are visualized using bar charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots.
5. **Marketing Strategy Development**: Tailored marketing strategies are proposed for each customer segment.

## Results

The analysis identified distinct customer segments, each with unique characteristics. For example:
- **Champions** make up 20% of the customer base but contribute 50% of revenue.
- **At Risk** customers have significantly decreased their purchase frequency, indicating a need for re-engagement campaigns.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For potential clustering analysis (optional).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd customer-segmentation
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/rfm_analysis.ipynb
    ```

## Future Work

- **Clustering Analysis**: Implement clustering techniques such as K-Means or DBSCAN to further refine customer segments.
- **Real-Time Segmentation**: Integrate the RFM analysis into a real-time data pipeline for continuous segmentation.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Develop more interactive and dynamic dashboards to visualize customer segments.
